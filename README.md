# Teleoperated Multi-ROSbot SLAM #

![ROSBot2](figures/profile.JPG)

## Overview ##
This package contains launch files and nodes needed to let multiple Husarion 
ROSbots collaboratively map an unknown environment from unknown starting 
positions. Each robot generates its own map using lidar scans, and they are 
merged together on the `/merged_map` channel.

## Dependencies ##
In order to use all these packages, you also need to install the following ROS 
packages on each ROSBot:
- `multirobot_map_merge`
- `rosbot_description`
- `husarion_ros`


## Setup ##
In order to run this system, a single ROSbot (Jaguar) will be the ROS Master, 
and a second ROSBot (Samba) will join the ROS subnet. Additionally, one or more 
operator laptops must be on the same network in order to teleoperate the 
ROSbots. There are a number of environment variables that need to be set in 
order for the networking to function well. 
1. We found that in our VirtualBox Ubuntu machines, we needed to set our Network Adapter to Bridged mode.
2. You must know the IP address of every machine involved. Jaguar is 
`10.101.84.77` and Samba is `10.101.84.78`.
3. For every machine involved, the environment variable `ROS_MASTER_URI` must be set to 
    `http://10.101.84.77:11311`, and `ROS_IPV6` must be set to `OFF`.
4. For every machine involved, the environment variable `ROS_IP` must be set 
to the ip address of that particular computer.

## Launching the system
In order to start mapping, you will need to SSH into the both ROSbots in order 
to launch the required nodes. The username and password for both ROSbots is 'husarion'.

On Jaguar, run the following commands:
```
    cd ~/ros_workspace
    source devel/setup.sh
    roslaunch multi_rosbot_launch rosbot1_teleop_robot.launch
```

On Samba, run the following commands:
```
    cd ~/ros_workspace
    source devel/setup.sh
    roslaunch multi_rosbot_launch rosbot2_teleop_robot.launch
```


To Run Rviz on an operator computer:
```
    cd ~/ros_workspace
    source devel/setup.sh
    rviz
```

To Begin Teleoperating Jaguar from a terminal on an operator computer:
```
    cd ~/ros_workspace
    source devel/setup.sh
    roslaunch multi_rosbot_launch rosbot1_teleop.launch
```

To Begin Teleoperating Samba from a terminal on an operator computer:
```
    cd ~/ros_workspace
    source devel/setup.sh
    roslaunch multi_rosbot_launch rosbot2_teleop.launch
```

To Save a completed merged map:
```
    cd ~/ros_workspace
    source devel/setup.sh
    rosrun map_server map_saver map:=/merged_map -f <output_filename>
```

# With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility:
## Andrew
Andrew was the de facto leader of the group. He had the most experience with ROS and was able to guide every other member when they ran into any issues. Andrew was responsible for integrating the multi-map merge package into our system in both simulation and hardware. Andrew also contributed to setting up the multi-robot teleop in both simulation and hardware.
## Alex
Alex was another hard-working member. Alex spent a lot of time working alongside Andrew together they brought up the multi-map merge and multi-robot teleop. Alex also worked on the explore lite frontier exploration as well as did a lot of manual testing and driving of the rosbot systems.

## Patrick
Patrick was invaluable to setting up the Rosbots. We ran into a lot of issues when we started to move away from simulations and onto physical components. Patrick worked dilligently with Anas to get both of our Rosbots up and running, where he had to debug some hardware/ electrical issues with the Rosbots, one of which ended up being a pesky connection issue with our Lidar.

## Devin
Devin was solely responsible for bringing up the RRT package into system. This package allows for multiple agents to perform frontier exploration efficiently as they will tend towards taking different routes to explore. Devin also brought in the extra maps used in our simulations to further test our exploration algorithms.

- essentially, the `tf_prefix` is not really supported since most packages failed
to implement it correctly to begin with. As a result, if you're relying on `tf_prefix`
to correctly namespace your `tf frames`, you will have a bad time. Trust us. 
Been there. Done that.

# Known Issues #
![Guts](figures/guts.JPG)
- The multibot_map_merge fails when we try to give it initial poses. We're 
working on a solution, but for now, please stick to the unknown-initial-position 
method
- Even when it works, the map merging can be finnicky. It works more reliably 
in simulation than in real life, unfortunately. We've been working on debugging 
and tuning it to get more reliable map merging.
- We had some network connectivity issues where the connection would fail while 
a ROSbot was in the middle of executing a motion command. When this happens, 
there may be no way to stop the robot besides doing it manually.
- In the Teleoperated Multi-ROSbot SLAM system, the two robots do not know to 
remove each other from their occupancy maps. This could theoretically be a 
possible feature in future revisions.
- Jaguar's Lidar seems to have a finnicky USB connection. We had to open it up 
and reseat the connection.
- Even with 4+ cores and 8+ GB of RAM in a VirtualBox VM, we found that Gazebo 
and Rviz were laggy in our simulations.

# EXTRA NOTE! # 
Though it isn't in Master yet and hasn't been tested on hardware, we have a 
Rapidly Exploring Random Tree frontier exploration feature in a development 
branch called `rrt`. Check it out, and read the README on that branch!
