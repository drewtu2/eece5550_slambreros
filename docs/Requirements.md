Objectives: In addition to the standard project, our project will
1. Create a unified map based on data readings from N robots. 
2. Update map readings in real time

Requirements: In addition to the standard project, our project must 
1. Robots will have the ability to communicate with a central server to send data about its environment and query map information.
2. The resulting map will be created in a shorter amount of time than a single robot would be capable of.
3. The robots shall try to explore in different directions and avoid remapping.
4. The robots will create a unified map, and resolve feature conflicts.
